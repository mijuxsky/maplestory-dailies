# MapleStory Dailies

A minimal tracker for your dailies in MapleStory.

## Key Features
- **Themes & Presets** — Light (Light, Cloud, Lavender, Matcha) and Dark (Dark, Evergreen). Three local **Presets** to save/load layouts.
- **Zero to 20 characters** — Start with **zero** cards; add up to 20. Each new card starts with 2 tasks (min 1, max 10). Everything saves locally.
- **Keyboard** — Enter/Tab/↓ to move forward (auto-adds lines); ↑/Shift+Tab up; ←/→ to switch cards at edges.
- **Reorder cards** — Drag any character card to any position in the grid (smooth & snappy).
- **Reorder tasks** — Drag **⋮⋮** to reorder tasks within a card.
- **Insert between** — Press **Enter** on a task to insert a new line directly **below** it.
- **Check-All per card** — A “Check All” toggle above tasks marks/unmarks all checkboxes. Indeterminate when mixed.
- **Avatars & Info** — From the card’s name field or **Set Avatar** popup, fetch avatar + **Lv./Class** from MapleRanks (via your Worker). Or upload an image.
- **Daily reset** — All checkboxes reset automatically at **00:00 UTC**. Live UTC clock shown in **MM/DD/YYYY** format.
- **Import/Export** — Save your data to a JSON file and restore it on another device (no servers).
- **Delete confirm** — Deleting a character asks: **“Are you sure you want to delete the character: <Character Name>?”** (Yes/No).
- **Mobile toolbar** — On phones, **Theme**, **Preset**, and **Add Character**/Export/Import each sit on their **own line** so labels never split.
